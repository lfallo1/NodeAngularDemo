  Youtube.com limits filtering and sorting options, for reasons that I'm sure are valid.  But they limit the options nonetheless.
  <br /><br />
  Wanna sort by the best rated videos?  Well, you're going to get a bunch of videos with 37 views - because, hey, they've got 100% rating.  Wanna see the most viewed?  Well, now you've lost your sorting option - and are stuck with viral, over viewed videos you've seen a thousand times.  There are similar issues searching within date ranges as the relevance drops significantly.  Perhaps when searching, you'd really like to filter out a specific channel or keyword from results.
  <br /><br />
  YoutubeAgent aims to solve these issues allowing users to search with any combination of sorts and filters to maximize search result relevance. You as the user decide - through filter / sort options - exactly how searches should be performed.  Wanna search for college football pump up vids with ratings of 98+, a view count over 3000 in the past 18 months, sorted by view count?  No problemo!
  <br /><br />
  The purpose for creating YoutubeAgent is the customizable searching, but features also include direct-link video / audio download capability, built-in processing to maximize the number of videos returned, analyzing of search results, editing of your personal Youtube playlists through google-signin, advanced post search text filters, and saving / uploading of results in a JSON format (this can come in handy if you perform a long search with many results, but would like to scrape through them later. just download the JSON and upload it some other time to re-populate your search results).
